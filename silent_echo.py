'''
This code is a simple echo project that creates the specified number of vbs files these files can be replaced by other more violent files, 
    but this case is only for educational methods.
The objective of the project (EDUCATIONAL) is that when executing the python code, several vbs files containing tricks are created, 
    so many files that the user's machine starts to have problems.
